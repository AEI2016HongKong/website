    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <div class="col bg margin"> 
      <h2></h2>
      <p> We are a team of four students from Eckerd College who took part in the Asia & the Environment Initiative during the spring and summer of 2016. The initiative is split into two parts: a course held during the spring semester in St. Petersburg, Florida, wherein we studied the historical, socioeconomical, and environmental background of our host country and conducted research on contemporary environmental challenges of our choosing, and a month-long internship abroad where we performed labwork and fieldwork alongside students and professors from Hong Kong Baptist University in Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong. The research projects we worked on all focused on assessing and protecting Hong Kong's biodiversity, and in the process of doing so they took us to the farthest parts of the region. This website is dedicated to hosting our findings and our memories from the past six months.  </p>

I’m a Psychology major from Hamilton, New Jersey, and I wanted to join this program for new cultural experience and to learn about something out of my normal realm of practice. I also have minors in Chinese, Leadership
          Studies, and Human Development, so the environmental element of this trip was refreshing and fun for me.

As an undergraduate student in the sciences, the opportunity to conduct meaningful environmental reasearch alongside graduate
          and doctoral students was already impossible to pass up; that the program would take me to Hong Kong and immerse me in a whole new culture was the icing on the cake.

I joined this program because I have never been exposed to environmental work. The idea of studying the environment
          in a foreign country was very appealing to my interests. This program also allowed me the opportunity to practice my Chinese in an immersive city filled with many native speakers of Cantonese and Mandarin. Programs such as this one, allow for
          a unique fusion of cultural, scientific and linguistic knowledge to learned its participants.

          and was unfamiliar with the environmental issues Hong Kong is facing. I was excited about the opportunity to study in the classroom in the spring and participate in hands-on research in a different country in the summer. Majoring in business,
          we rarely think about the environment and I believe this was a great opportunity to better understand the perspective of an environmentalist as a business major hoping to work abroad after graduation to make sure that the environment is also
          a concern to us.

              <p>The research we did in Hong Kong consisted of studying the behaviors and diets of different species of small local, endemic, and foreign animals including land snails, turtles, tree frogs, bull frogs, and lizards. The focus of Doctor Hei,
                the professor that we worked with at Hong Kong Baptist University, was mainly on local turtles and their illegal trade. </p>
              <p> Doctor Hei worked to learn a great deal about illegal turtle trade locally, even heading to the markets to acquire information, and we helped him work to compile data on illegal turtle trade online using a reptile sale website. For our first
                project on land snails we went on a few trips to local natural parks, collected as many snails as we could find in a particular blocked out area. Later at the lab we searched through collected leaf litter to double check for any leftover
                snail shells.</p>
              <p> We also collected information on Chinese Water Dragons and Chinese Bullfrogs, two foreign animals, to find out the effect they have on local and endemic species of frogs. We collected data on the diets of Chinese Water Dragons by catching
                them on night hikes and pumping their stomachs with water. Similarly, we took hikes to local parks and collected Chinese Bullfrogs in plastic bags, took their measurements later at the lab, and dissected them for the contents of their
                stomachs.

        <p> The four of us were so lucky to have the opportunity to live and work in Hong Kong over the summer, and we could not be more thankful to have been chosen for this honor. We would like to take a moment and recognize those who made this life-changing summer a reality. </p>
     <p>To Eckerd College's Professor Andrew Chittick and Professor David Duncan, thank you for leading and organizing this once-in-a-lifetime experience. Your vast knowlegde and deep connections served invaluable to us all over the course of the spring and summer. </p>
        <p> To Hong Kong Baptist University's Professor Anna Leung, Professor Jian-Wen Qiu, Professor Hei Sung, and all of the students we met while in the laboratory and in the field, we cannot thank you enough for your kindness and hospitality during our time in Hong Kong. It was an honor and a pleasure to have been able to get to know all of you, and we hope to return the favor when you come to Eckerd College! </p>
        <p> And finally, thank you to the Henry Luce Foundation and the Luce Initiative on Asian Studies and the Environment for their commitment to the Eckerd Colleges Asia & the Environment Initiative. Without your support, we wouldn't have been able to meet the fantastic people we have met, learn what we have about Hong Kong and it's fascinating environmental challenges, or participate in the kind of meaningful research we were involved in this  summer. </p>
